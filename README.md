  Turn Order:
    1. Roll the dice and Resolve events (collect resources or move robber)
    2. Trade resources or use ports owned
    3. Use Dev Cards
    4. Purchase and Build
    
  Key runtime things:
    1. Settlements must be built at least 2 road spaces away from another settlment/city
    2. Settlements are built and later may be upgraded to a city
    3. Robber gets moved on the roll of a 7 or the use of a knight. This triggers the robbing of a player on that hex. Anyone with 7+ cards discards half (on the roll only)
    4. Robbers block resources from generating on the hex in which in resides
    5. Development cards must be held 1 turn before played
    6. All building placements and purchases are final
    7. 10 Victory Points (VP) to win the game!
